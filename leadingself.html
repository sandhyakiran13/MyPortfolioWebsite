                                When I began the fellowship, my understanding of lesson planning was basic. Over time, I have made significant progress and now place myself at a 3-3.5 level (out of 5) in the LIT pillars: Connect, Envision, Plan, Execute, and Reflect. I see challenges as opportunities for growth, both in skills and mindset. Through training in the Leadership in Teaching framework and content-focused sessions in Literacy and Social Sciences, I have developed a certain level of ability to design purposeful and impactful lesson plans using the 5 Magic Questions framework, focusing on purpose, integration, mastery, methods, and partnerships.
                                I have grown into an educator who places students at the center of every decision, prioritizing their needs, growth, and holistic development. I actively create and engage in collaborative initiatives that empower students to build interests and hobbies that leading self, others and india</p>
