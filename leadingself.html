                            <p class="text-center">Through my fellowship, I have grown significantly in lesson planning, now placing myself at a 3-3.5 level in the LIT pillars: Connect, Envision, Plan, Execute, and Reflect. Training in the Leadership in Teaching framework and deep dives into Literacy and Social Sciences have helped me design purposeful lessons using the 5 Magic Questions framework. I now view challenges as opportunities for growth, ensuring my studentsâ€™ needs, development, and holistic well-being remain at the center of every decision.</p>
                            <p>This journey has deepened my understanding of educational inequity, reinforcing key insights: the need for intentionality in education, the power of collective responsibility, and the urgency for skilled, passionate teachers. I aspire to lead by being an educator, continuously honing my strengths and working on my areas of development to become better. My goal is to create student leaders who not only take charge of their own learning but also contribute to solving inequities in education and addressing challenges in their communities.</p>
