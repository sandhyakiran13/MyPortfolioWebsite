            <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
            <p>My name is Sandhyakiran Saroj, and I hold a degree in Psychology and English Literature from Mumbai University. Before becoming a Teach For India fellow, I was myself a TFI student at a Government school in Goregaon, Mumbai. In my two years of the Teach For India Fellowship, I had the opportunity to teach in two different schools in each year.</p>

            <h3>What inspired Me to be a Fellow?</h3>
            <p>This is a picture of me holding a quilling card given to me by my TFI teacher appreciate my hard work in my classroom, later quilling became one of my hobbies. I am deeply grateful for the guidance of Teach For India fellows, who showed me that school and learning can be enjoyable. This experience inspired me to pursue the Teach For India fellowship.</p>

            <h3>A Journey of Beginnings: Stepping into Change and Growth</h3>
            <p> During my final year of BA, I volunteered at a KER showcase where someone from TFI suggested I join the fellowship. Excited, I applied right after graduation. On 24th April 2023, I received my offer letter and shared the news with the fellows who had supported me.
              This picture was taken on 7th May 2023, the day I left for institute training. It was my first time away from family for a month and a half. I was eager to return stronger with the skills and mindset to create change in my community. 
              At the institute, I met inspiring people, learned about education as a wicked problem, and discovered the importance of relationships and culture in student learning. It was a journey of growth and transformation.
