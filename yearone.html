                    <p>Due to the extended school closures during the 2020 to 2022 lockdown period, many students in 5th and 6th grades experienced significant learning loss, particularly in reading, comprehension, speaking, and writing skills in English. With schools transitioning to online learning, many students were unable to access the same level of support and resources they would have received in a traditional classroom setting. As a result, by the time they reached 8th grade, their reading levels were closer to that of 3rd or 4th graders, leading to a considerable gap in their academic development.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">Academic Disparities and Their Impact on Classroom Cohesion</h3>
                    <p>Some students were at lower academic levels due to the challenges mentioned earlier, while others were at relatively higher levels. The students at lower levels often lacked confidence, and the disparity in skill levels created a divide, leading to discrimination and a lack of cohesion within the classroom. This difference in abilities hindered the development of a strong classroom culture or sense of teamwork.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">Impact of Inconsistent Teaching</h3>
                    <p>Due to some personal challenges, the teacher for other subjects (Math and Science) had difficulty maintaining a regular presence in school. This occasional discontinuity in instruction created some gaps in the students' education. As I was already teaching English and Social Studies, stepping in to cover other subjects on short notice proved to be challenging for both the students and myself, as it added to their learning loss. While the intent was always to support the students, the absence of consistent teaching in these subjects made it harder to address their academic needs fully.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">No Access to Practical Computer Skills</h3>
                    <p>In a world where digital education and computer literacy are increasingly essential, our school faced a significant challenge due to the lack of a functional computer lab. Students were only taught computer skills through textbooks, with little to no hands-on experience or practical application. This limited approach hindered their ability to develop essential digital skills, putting them at a disadvantage in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.</p>

                    <p>Based on the MOY data, I categorized my students into three groups according to their Reading Comprehension (RC) levels: Dolphins (low rigor), Tigers (medium rigor), and Eagles (high rigor). Initially, I used a uniform approach by creating the same type of RC lesson plans and worksheets for all students. However, I soon realized this method was ineffective in addressing their diverse learning needs. To resolve this, I began developing differentiated worksheets tailored to the specific requirements of each group, ensuring more effective and personalized learning experiences.</p>

                    <p>I also began conducting differentiated extra classes to support high-risk students and high-potential learners, helping them bridge the gap in reading comprehension. I used available resources, such as the bridge curriculum, to enhance their learning experience.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the year, I experimented with various methods to make Social Studies (SST) more engaging, as many students disliked the subject. One effective approach was teaching through story maps and graphic organizers. I also introduced mind maps, where students used basic WH questions (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How) to simplify lengthy texts into smaller concepts. The mind maps and graphic organizers helped students understand and articulate answers better so that they could recall them in exams.</p>

                    <p>To promote collaboration, I created heterogeneous groups with students from different rigor levels. Each student was held accountable for their group's performance. During lessons, I ensured that they engaged in at least one group activity, project, or teamwork task. This helped students interact and bond with each other regardless of gender.</p>

                    <p>At the beginning of the semester, we conducted a group goal-setting activity where students reflected on their academic aspirations. They wrote down the goals they hoped to achieve and discussed the specific actions they could take to reach those goals. This exercise helped them develop a clearer sense of purpose and accountability for their academic growth.</p>

                        <p>Jyoti Chauhan opposed making school uniforms compulsory. She pointed out that students face corporal punishment for not wearing uniforms, causing stress. The high cost means families can only afford two pairs, leading to hygiene issues. Her strongest argument was the discomfort girls face with frock-style uniforms, especially during menstruation, which makes simple tasks like sitting or climbing stairs difficult and uncomfortable. <a href="video_link_1.html">Watch the video</a></p>
