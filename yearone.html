                                    <p class="text-center">My first year of fellowship began at Shivshakti Vidyalaya, a low-income private school in Kandivali (W). The school had six classrooms, a small compound, and two toilets, though only one was usable, shared by boys, girls, and staff. I was assigned to teach 28 eighth graders in a classroom that was small and filled to capacity. Despite the limited space and resources, I was excited and ready to take on the challenge of teaching a new group of students, looking forward to learning and growing with them.</p>

                            <p>Due to the extended school closures during the 2020 to 2022 lockdown period, many students in 5th and 6th grades experienced significant learning loss, particularly in reading, comprehension, speaking, and writing skills in English. With schools transitioning to online learning, many students were unable to access the same level of support and resources they would have received in a traditional classroom setting. As a result, by the time they reached 8th grade, their reading levels were closer to that of 3rd or 4th graders, leading to a considerable gap in their academic development.</p>

                            <h3 class="text-center">Academic Disparities and Their Impact on Classroom Cohesion</h3>
                            <p>Some students were at lower academic levels due to the challenges mentioned earlier, while others were at relatively higher levels. The students at lower levels often lacked confidence, and the disparity in skill levels created a divide, leading to discrimination and a lack of cohesion within the classroom. This difference in abilities hindered the development of a strong classroom culture or sense of teamwork.</p>

                            <h3 class="text-center">Impact of Inconsistent Teaching</h3>
                            <p>Due to some personal challenges, the teacher for other subjects (Math and Science) had difficulty maintaining a regular presence in school. This occasional discontinuity in instruction created some gaps in the students' education. As I was already teaching English and Social Studies, stepping in to cover other subjects on short notice proved to be challenging for both the students and myself, as it added to their learning loss. While the intent was always to support the students, the absence of consistent teaching in these subjects made it harder to address their academic needs fully.</p>

                            <p>In a world where digital education and computer literacy are increasingly essential, our school faced a significant challenge due to the lack of a functional computer lab. Students were only taught computer skills through textbooks, with little to no hands-on experience or practical application. This limited approach hindered their ability to develop essential digital skills, putting them at a disadvantage in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.</p>

                                        Based on the MOY data, I categorized my students into three groups according to their Reading Comprehension (RC) levels: Dolphins (low rigor), Tigers (medium rigor), and Eagles (high rigor). Initially, I used a uniform approach by creating the same type of RC

                                          lesson plans and worksheets for all students. However, I soon realized this method was ineffective in addressing their diverse learning needs. To resolve this, I began developing differentiated worksheets tailored to the specific requirements of each group, ensuring more effective and personalized learning experiences. This approach allowed me to better cater to the individual needs of my students, providing them with the support they needed to improve their reading comprehension skills.

                                    <p>Throughout the year, I experimented with various methods to make Social Studies (SST) more engaging, as many students disliked the subject. One effective approach was teaching through story maps and graphic organizers. I also introduced mind maps, where students used basic WH questions (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How) to simplify lengthy texts into smaller concepts. The mind maps and graphic organizers helped students understand and articulate answers better so that they could recall them in exams. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14nNmV4tidd-sdNjpket3ENudf7Rc8O9D/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102457876847622713407&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank">Link to lesson plan</a></p>

In his usual humorous way, Tufail pointed out that, despite the funds, there hasn’t been much improvement in the school infrastructure, which he feels is a real issue for the students.

                                    <p>To address the digital divide and lack of computer literacy among students, a collaboration with Bloomberg was established. Volunteers conducted sessions to teach students how to use computers and laptops effectively. Over 4-5 sessions at Bloomberg’s office, students learned skills such as using Microsoft Excel and Google Docs, which boosted their confidence in handling technology and improved their performance in computer exams.</p>

                                    <p>For students requiring psychological support, a partnership with Atma Prakash facilitated a mental health session, and a counselor was arranged to provide individual counseling sessions weekly over six months. This intervention led to noticeable behavioral improvements. Additionally, a project was designed to address challenges like low self-esteem, exclusion, peer pressure, and lack of confidence. Weekly activities like entangling human knot, obstacle challenge, making the tallest tower with newspapers, etc were conducted, followed by reflection and learning discussions, creating a positive impact on the students’ emotional and mental well-being.</p>

                                    <p>At the beginning of the year, one of my students, Rizwan, was feeling quite uneasy, which made it difficult for him to come to school. However, after receiving consistent support through counseling, he showed significant progress. Over time, he became more confident, started attending school regularly, and seemed much more secure. Another student, Deepak, gradually became more engaged in class and began initiating conversations with me. It’s been truly rewarding to see both of them grow and become more active and connected in the school environment.</p>

                                    <p>During my first year as a teacher, I faced the challenge of balancing overwhelming responsibilities with limited support. Often, I found myself managing the class, addressing behavioral issues, and handling additional tasks alone, which was particularly difficult as a new teacher still learning the ropes. This lack of guidance made the experience both exhausting and isolating. I also encountered situations where I had to stand up for ethical practices. Taking action against certain concerning behaviors and advocating for the well-being of students was necessary but led to strained relationships with colleagues and a lack of support from the staff. This made it even harder to navigate the already challenging environment.</p>
                                    <p>Despite these challenges, I still enjoyed being with my students, finding joy and purpose in our interactions. However, the cumulative pressure and emotional toll eventually led me to change schools and start my fellowship in a new environment—one where I could grow and thrive with better alignment to my values.</p>
