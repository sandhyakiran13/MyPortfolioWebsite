                    <p>Due to the extended school closures during the 2020 to 2022 lockdown period, many students in 5th and 6th grades experienced significant learning loss, particularly in reading, comprehension, speaking, and writing skills in English. With schools transitioning to online learning, many students were unable to access the same level of support and resources they would have received in a traditional classroom setting. As a result, by the time they reached 8th grade, their reading levels were closer to that of 3rd or 4th graders, leading to a considerable gap in their academic development.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">Academic Disparities and Their Impact on Classroom Cohesion</h3>
                    <p>Some students were at lower academic levels due to the challenges mentioned earlier, while others were at relatively higher levels. The students at lower levels often lacked confidence, and the disparity in skill levels created a divide, leading to discrimination and a lack of cohesion within the classroom. This difference in abilities hindered the development of a strong classroom culture or sense of teamwork.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">Impact of Inconsistent Teaching</h3>
                    <p>Due to some personal challenges, the teacher for other subjects (Math and Science) had difficulty maintaining a regular presence in school. This occasional discontinuity in instruction created some gaps in the students' education. As I was already teaching English and Social Studies, stepping in to cover other subjects on short notice proved to be challenging for both the students and myself, as it added to their learning loss. While the intent was always to support the students, the absence of consistent teaching in these subjects made it harder to address their academic needs fully.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">No Access to Practical Computer Skills</h3>
                    <p>In a world where digital education and computer literacy are increasingly essential, our school faced a significant challenge due to the lack of a functional computer lab. Students were only taught computer skills through textbooks, with little to no hands-on experience or practical application. This limited approach hindered their ability to develop essential digital skills, putting them at a disadvantage in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.</p>
